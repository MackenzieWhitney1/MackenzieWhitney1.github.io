My name is Mackenzie Whitney.
I've been in the tech industry for close to 10 years now as QA.
I'm now attending SAIT to get my Object Oriented Software Development certification so I can work as a Developer.
I strive to make work processes easier. 
When I was QA, I would help automate smoke tests and lead in writing and reviewing test cases.
As a classmate collaborating on labs with others, I try to find effective design patterns to make work easier.
